## Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
Diabetic Retinopathy Detection 

### Project Overview
This project aims to address the global challenge of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of blindness, by using deep learning models to detect and classify its severity levels from retinal fundus images. The study utilizes an ensemble of pre-trained models and leverages advanced techniques like transfer learning and data augmentation to improve detection accuracy.

### Key Features
- **Dataset:** 3,662 retinal fundus images from the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection competition.
- **Models Used:** ResNet50, ResNet152, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, and InceptionV3.
- **Approach:** Ensemble method using majority voting to combine the strengths of individual models.
- **Deployment:** A user-friendly Streamlit-based web application for real-time predictions.

### Screenshots of Application
The chosen model (EfficientNetB0) was deployed in a Streamlit web application, which allows clinicians to upload retinal images and receive predictions on DR severity.
